    "# Smoothing out Time Series Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series data can be quite noisy, with a lot of up and down spikes. To better see a trend we can plot an average of, say 6 or 12 observations. This is called the rolling mean. We calculate the average in a window of time and move it forward by one overservation. Pandas has two handy methods already built in to work this out: [rolling()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.rolling.html) and [mean()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.core.window.rolling.Rolling.mean.html).
